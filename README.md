# [Project Title: Automated Image Processing Pipeline]
Automated Image Processing using DevOps CI Pipeline

## Requirements!!
Python 3 | OpenCV | GitHub Actions | PyTest 

## 📝 Project Overview
The Automated Image Processing Pipeline is a Python-based computer vision system that applies a sequence of OpenCV image processing techniques to extract clean object outlines from images.

The pipeline removes background noise, smooths image textures, converts images into grayscale, detects edges, and refines contours using morphological operations. These steps work together to transform raw images into simplified structural representations suitable for visualization or further analysis.

The system demonstrates how multiple image-processing filters can be combined into a single automated workflow.
